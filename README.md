# Logic-Simulator

Design a simple logic simulator that provides a mechanism to run and simulate logic circuits then find the desired outputs for different designs.

Sample Input:

    AND A B D
    OR C D E
    SET A 1
    SET B 0 
    SET C 1
    SIM 
    OUT E
    OUT ALL

Sample Output:

    E: 1
    A: 1
    B: 0
    D: 0
    C: 1
    E: 1
